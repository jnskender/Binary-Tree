#Binary Tree
[View Project Requirements](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms)

This is my implementation of a Binary Tree data structure with Ruby.    
I create a tree of nodes from a shuffled array and allow for searching of specific values
by a breadth first search or a depth first search. Upon successful finding of a node, it will print that nodes parent, left child and right child.  

##Takeaways
*Further practice with recursion
*Understanding practical use with decision trees
*Must learn rspec for TDD as this would have been a great asset for testing
*I am solidifying my process of
 1) Speaking problem
 2) Writing Psuedocode
 3) Solving problem
 4) Refactor/Optimization
